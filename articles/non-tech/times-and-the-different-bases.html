<p>There are many different ways and styles to write time. Especially so when denoting the separation with the hour and minute digits.</p>
<p><code>22:10</code> vs <code>22.10</code> vs <code>2210</code><br />
<sub><em>10:10pm in 24 hour format with 3 different common separators</em></sub></p>
<p>Since young, I've been taught to use the colon(<code>:</code>) for all my hour-minute separation needs.<br />
More recently however, I have started to see the dot/full-stop (<code>.</code>) being used more frequently in text to communicate time.</p>
<p>It is easier (on both phone and computer) to use the <code>.</code> over <code>:</code> when chatting. However, I've also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion">started to see it more frequently</a> in official announcements, publicity, etc.</p>
<p>While many can argue it's simply a style choice, I don't think it's as simple as that (When it is about relative timings - not absolute timings)</p>
<h2 id="1-it-is-not-linguistically-accurate">1. It is not linguistically accurate.</h2>
<p>Text emulates speech (and vice versa). For example, &quot;1:50&quot; means &quot;one hour, fifty minutes&quot; with zero ambiguity. On the other hand. &quot;1.50&quot; either means &quot;one point five hours&quot; or &quot;one hour, fifty minutes&quot;.</p>
<p>When someone says <em>&quot;It's one and a half hours&quot;</em>, it can be represented in text as: <em>&quot;1:30, 1.5, 1.30&quot;</em>. In this case, the decimal point has two correct representations: <code>1.5</code>, and <code>1.30</code>. These differing interpretations can conflict and lead to misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Of course, one can gather from contextual clues that <code>1.5</code> means &quot;one and a half&quot; and <code>1.50</code> means &quot;one fifty&quot;. So honestly, it's not <em>that</em> bad.</p>
<h2 id="2-they-are-different-bases">2. They are different bases.</h2>
<p>We use the '.' for many different reasons. Most notably, mathematics uses it as a decimal point for our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160505151914/http://cowbirdsinlove.com/43">base-10</a> system.</p>
<p>However, as it turns out, minutes are <em>not</em> base 100. An hour does not have 100 minutes, but 60. As such, minutes are functionally base-60.</p>
<p>As the full stop/decimal point is already used in mathematical contexts with a decimal base, applying the <code>.</code> makes less sense when referring to time; especially when there is <code>:</code>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While it is a lot more convenient to use <code>.</code> when referring to time, I believe that using the <code>:</code> as the GOTO separator of time...</p>
