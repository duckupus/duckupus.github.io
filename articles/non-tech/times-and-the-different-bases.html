<p>There are many different ways to write time. As an example, you can choose either the 12 or 24 hour format to show the time. However, I think that's an overrated topic. Instead, how do you split the hour and minute digits?</p>
<p>As far as I know, there are three main ways of splitting digits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the colon (<code>10:10pm</code>)</li>
<li>Using the full-stop (<code>10.10pm</code>)</li>
<li>Using the (<code>1010pm</code>)</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>22:10
22.10
2210
</code></pre>
<p><sup><em>10:10pm in 24 hour format with 3 different common separators</em></sup></p>
<p>I have grown up using the colon for all my hour-minute time separation needs. More recently however, I have started to see the dot/full-stop being used more frequently in text to communicate time. While I do understand that it is easier (on both phone and computer) to use the <code>.</code> over <code>:</code> when chatting. I have also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_illusion">started to see it more frequently</a> in official announcements, publicity, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, it can also simply be a choice of style. However, I would argue that it's <em>slightly</em> more nuanced then that.</p>
<h2 id="they-are-different-bases">They are different bases.</h2>
<p>We use the '.' for many different reasons. Most notably, mathematics uses it as a decimal point for our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160505151914/http://cowbirdsinlove.com/43">base-10</a> system.</p>
<p>However, as it turns out, minutes are <em>not</em> base 100. An hour does not have 100 minutes, but 60. As such, minutes are functionally base-60.</p>
<p>As the full stop/decimal point is already used in mathematical contexts with a decimal base, applying the <code>.</code> makes less sense when referring to time; especially when there is <code>:</code> to do the job.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While it is a lot more convenient to use <code>.</code> when referring to time, I believe that using the <code>:</code> as the GO-TO separator of time...</p>
